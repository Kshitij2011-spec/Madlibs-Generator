# Mad Libs Generator

A simple command-line application that generates a story by prompting the user to provide words to fill in the blanks.

## Installation

To use the Mad Libs Generator, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can download the `madlibs_generator.py` file and the `story.txt` file to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `madlibs_generator.py` file.
2. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```
   python madlibs_generator.py
   ```

3. The script will read the story template from the `story.txt` file and prompt you to enter words to fill in the blanks.
4. After you've entered all the words, the script will generate the completed story and display it in the terminal.

Here's an example of how the script works:

```
Enter a <adjective>: wonderful
Enter a <noun>: cat
Enter a <verb>: meowed
Enter a <adverb>: loudly

The wonderful cat meowed loudly through the park.
```

## API

The `madlibs_generator.py` script does not provide any API. It is a standalone command-line application.
